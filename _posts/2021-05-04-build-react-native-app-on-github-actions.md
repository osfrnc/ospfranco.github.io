At work we were using Bitrise to build our React-Native app. I have never been a fan of Bitrise, it is super slow compared to any other cloud provider out there and super pricey compared to those I have used in the past. That being said, it works well and their huge gallery steps probably cover most of the stuff one needs when building a mobile app in the cloud. However we recently started hitting our heads against the ceiling, after migrating to the latest version of React-Native, removing the checked pods and enabling Hermes, our iOS build simply did not fit inside a single workflow. The next tier vaguely says that we would pay anywhere from 200 to thousands of bucks, which was too vague for our taste.

## Migrating to Github Actions

So, previously I removed our pure JavaScript tests out of Bitrise (again because it is too damn slow) and into Github Actions. The process was simple and since it runs where the code already lives it is pretty sweet to have everything under the Github umbrella. So, after finding out Github actually has macOS machines you can use to build your app, I begged the team to see if we could try to migrate everything to Github. We were already using Fastlane before using Bitrise, so there was a `Fastfile` that I could more or less use after some updates, I just needed to set up the machines and the environments.

Here is our workflow file for our android build:

```yaml
name: Android GMS Staging

on:
  create:
    tags:
      - v*
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      message:
        description: 'Build description'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: docker://fabernovel/android:api-29-v1.1.0

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses : actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Node modules cache
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: '**/node_modules'
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}

      - name: Ruby cache
        uses: actions/cache@v1.2.0
        with:
          path: vendor/bundle
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-gems-

      - name: Gradle cache
        uses: actions/cache@v1.2.0
        with:
          path: /root/.gradle
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-gradle

      - name: Use Node 14
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install yarn
        run: npm install -g yarn

      - name: Install firebase CLI
        run: npm install -g firebase-tools

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Decode keystore file
        run: echo -n "$ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE" | base64 -d > ./my-release-key.keystore
        working-directory: ./android/app
        env:
          ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE: ${{ secrets.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE }}

      - name: Bundle install
        run: |
          bundle config path vendor/bundle
          bundle check || bundle install

      - name: Fastlane
        run: bundle exec fastlane android distribute_staging
        env:
          MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD }}
          MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS: ${{ secrets.MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS }}
          MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD }}
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

Nothing too fancy, basically using a pre-built image which already has the android SDK installed, then installing node dependencies, ruby dependencies, etc etc. The keystore file is in our github secrets and gets decoded into the machine. Finally it is just a matter of calling Fastlane, which takes care of all the final build steps, I did not want to put any more logic inside of the workflow, because we should also be able to run fastlane in our machines in case the CI is not an option or we need to do an emergency release for some reason.

For iOS, is somewhat similar:

```yaml
name: iOS Staging
on:
  create:
    tags:
      - v*
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      message:
        description: 'Build description'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macOS-latest
    # timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
    
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Node modules cache
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: '**/node_modules'
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}

      - name: Ruby cache
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: vendor/bundle
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gems-${{ hashFiles('**/Gemfile.lock') }}

      - name: Use Node 14
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install yarn
        run: npm install -g yarn

      - name: Install firebase CLI
        run: npm install -g firebase-tools

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Decode cert file
        run: echo -n "$P12_CODE_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64" | base64 -d > ./cert.p12
        env:
          P12_CODE_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64: ${{ secrets.P12_CODE_SIGNING_CERT_BASE64 }}

      - name: Decode adhoc prov file
        run: echo -n "$MOBILEPROVISION_ADHOC_BASE64" | base64 -d > ./mobileProvisionAdhoc.mobileprovision
        env:
          MOBILEPROVISION_ADHOC_BASE64: ${{ secrets.MOBILEPROVISION_ADHOC_BASE64 }}
      
      - name: Decode appstore prov file
        run: echo -n "$MOBILEPROVISION_APPSTORE_BASE64" | base64 -d > ./mobileProvisionAppstore.mobileprovision
        env:
          MOBILEPROVISION_APPSTORE_BASE64: ${{ secrets.MOBILEPROVISION_APPSTORE_BASE64 }}
      
      - name: Decode widget adhoc prov file
        run: echo -n "$MOBILEPROVISION_WIDGET_ADHOC_BASE64" | base64 -d > ./mobileProvisionWidgetAdhoc.mobileprovision
        env:
          MOBILEPROVISION_WIDGET_ADHOC_BASE64: ${{ secrets.MOBILEPROVISION_WIDGET_ADHOC_BASE64 }}
      
      - name: Decode widget appstore prov file
        run: echo -n "$MOBILEPROVISION_WIDGET_APPSTORE_BASE64" | base64 -d > ./mobileProvisionWidgetAppstore.mobileprovision
        env:
          MOBILEPROVISION_WIDGET_APPSTORE_BASE64: ${{ secrets.MOBILEPROVISION_WIDGET_APPSTORE_BASE64 }}

      - name: Bundle install
        run: |
          bundle config path vendor/bundle
          bundle check || bundle install

      - name: Fastlane
        run: bundle exec fastlane ios distribute_staging
        env:
          FIREBASE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIREBASE_TOKEN }}
```

The main difference (besides using a macos machine), is the unpacking and decoding of provisioning profiles and certificate. If you have used fastlane you will see there is some recommendation to use `match`, don't it's useless, it's a waste of time to set up and only to automate a task that you will probably do once a year (re-generate the certificate once it expires).

Another nice thing is the `workflow_dispatch` trigger, it allows you to trigger a workflow from the github UI (and you can put params, but as you can see I'm not using the description parameter yet).

## Results

The results are super good so far! I'm quite happy with it. Actual numbers:

|Target|Bitrise|Github|Reduction|
|---|---|---|---|
|iOS|~60 mins|~30 mins|50%
|Android|~35 mins|~20mins|42%
|Huawei|~35 mins|~20mins|42%

We are still not sure about the costs, since Github charges per build time, but we only build our apps maybe once a week so I would be really really surprised if we don't end up paying less, current gut feeling is we will pay around half of what we pay to Bitrise. However, be warned that if you run everything on mac instances (some UI testing for example), then Github can be way too expensive, so you might want to stay on Bitrise or Appcenter or other provider that does not charge per minute.

## Lessons learned

- As stated, skip fastlane's `match`, it's a waste of your time and your organization time (unless you regenerate certs/profiles every week or so)
- Fastlane scripts/plugins have some hidden behavior, do not try to create a new platform, stick to `ios` and `android`, we created a `huawei` platform and wasted a day trying to figure out why the apk was not detected for upload to firebase.
- Fastlane works on the `.fastlane` directory, github actions on the project root... this can be a pain to debug if you have to point to files directly.

## Was it worth it?

The process was slow (setting up CI is so painfully slow; trigger a build, wait 20 mins, realize var name is wrong ðŸ¤®), but it wasn't painful, being able to use pure bash (via fastlane or github steps) is heaven, even though Bitrise looks powerful with all the plugins, it's really freaking black-boxy with cryptic errors.

The speed has me super happy and everything is now integrated with github (our code, our issues and now our CI) which makes my life easier. I'm sure there are a few hairs here and there that need to be trimmed, but so far no complains. Github Actions are not perfect (fucking yaml... why do we keep using yaml?!) but hopefully you will find this guide useful if you are tired of abandonware (appcenter), slow CIs (bitrise), plain confusing (CircleCI).
