This is a small project made from data I collected from a german site called immoscout, although they don't provide an api, I was able to scrap some data, it shows the prices of rents in the federal republic, I still have the code somewhere around and could publish an interactive version if somebody is interested.

<br>

Since the data was not officially accessible by immoscout, I'm not sure if I should/could share the dataset I generated, guess I could get into trouble.

<br/>

You can clearly see major cities and their prices are quite high, and also the clear difference between east/west germany, you can find plenty of material online on why there is such a big economy disparity and the consequences on the german political system.
