When I was in my previous job I started writting some blog posts over stuff that I did and found interesting, over the years I've tried a few things, always trying to publish stuff in some way or another, I used some web services, tried bootstrapping a server running on a raspberry pie, but it simply takes too much time and effort to keep things running, so now I'm giving a go to github pages and jekyll, seems simple enough and fits my needs which is to publish stuff I do and/or stuff I find interesting as well as some rambling thoughts everyonce in a while.

I will be compiling the stuff I wrote in different pieces and sites and publishing them here, eventually I also want to bring some sort of commenting system into play eventually, in the mean time you can reach me via [email](mailto:ospfranco@protonmail.com)
