When I was in my previous job I started writting some blog posts over stuff that we did, solutions we found and stuff where we "innovated", you might not find breaking new stuff, but I try my best to do solid engineering at the companies I work for.

I used some web services, wrote a couple of articles on linkedin and medium, at some point started hating it, medium is just bloated and tries to force users visiting the site to join the money grabbing scheme, I do not want to endorse it anymore, tried bootstrapping a server running on a raspberry pie, but it simply takes too much time and effort to keep things running, so now I'm giving a go to github pages and jekyll, seems simple enough and fits the need to simple publish the stuff I need.

I will be compiling the stuff I wrote in different pieces and sites and publishing them here, eventually I also want to bring some sort of commenting system into play, in the mean time you can reach me via [email](mailto:ospfranco@protonmail.com)
