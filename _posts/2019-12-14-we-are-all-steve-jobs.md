Throughout the years I've noticed a few problems with the teams I've been working, 1. they have all been doing some sort of agile, 2. In all honesty, we sucked at creating a software product, by sucking I don't mean we did not deliver (some sort of) a product, but rather, the process was so convoluted so full of misunderstandings that the default work mode is discussion and frustration, which for developers takes away from valuable time to focus.

I've been taking a deep look inside, because as of late, I don't feel happy with work, some of the problems I'm experiencing are superficial, spending a lot of time polishing the UI, cleaning somebody else's code, to those I know the answer to, they are trivial, but there is a bigger problem here, somewhere along the way I lost the most important part to do what I do, I feel I spend my time arguing with teams about communication, about specifications, about working together, about building the right thing, constantly trying to keep a boat on course to some foggy destination... The world has been eaten by software, you either understand computers or you are nothing, and you either work with computers or you future is certainly doomed, all trying to build the next facebook, we are all steve jobs, building the next big thing, and there is just such a deep misunderstanding... we try to patch the hole, elevate everyone as if everyone can create the next apple computer! We need to understand the client problem, we produce tickets! and we are doing scrum, we can track the progress! look at our ticket board! and we have designs! oh, and by the way it needs to be done for yesterday.

Now, to be honest I don't glorify Steve Jobs, he clearly had many flaws and I don't think I would have liked working with him, but do think he was a man of vision, and there a quite few men of vision who are quite successful (The Zuck, Bezos, etc..), the problem I've noticed over time is that for 98% the teams don't have vision, dare to say even passion, we are a bunch of random people who may not have even worked on the problem area, and we are creating a product for people we have no relation with, and we expect to know what to do? if you have no clue of the solution how can you write it down? you are in a reactive mode, problem pops up, you smack it with a hammer, how can I estimate that? Over the years I've been trying to teach people how to write a proper ticket so I can do some sort of estimation, but it just doesn't stick, because people don't think in tickets, if your vision of a solution was clear than maybe you can put some sort of formal definition, but people with no vision think in even more abstract and foggy terms, do you think if I had a third of Steve Jobs's vision and creativity I would be sitting here on the 3 Start-Up of my career? BUT MOST OF US ARE NOT CREATIVE, [creativity is hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocDli45faiw) and [the median score for creativity is 0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYYJlNbV1OM&feature=youtu.be&t=23m40s)

Doesn't take a genius to see, it's a relationship doomed to failed, everyone gets frustrated, devs are not happy with management because the impossible is asked, management is not happy because they don't get to see in to the future and actually manage... something. With some of teams I've worked with, this has come close to working, if there is truly a strong technical person on a management that can communicate (or produce) a vision, he/she can understand the problems and sometimes even provide solutions, some real world examples that have happened to me: "don't over optimize, we will pay for more servers", "I see your problem, I'll convince the client it is too much of a time effort", but before reaching to that conclusion there was a conversation with a strong technical component, the manager can understand complexity and drawbacks and can translate that to other management people, manage expectation and communicate to other non-technicals, good management people know what they don't know and let the teams do their job, but like I said, this has only worked with strong technical or at least experienced management, for young teams or teams with too much of a variety of people this has never worked, doesn't matter how much Agile-flavored methodology has been thrown into the mix.

So... what is the solution you ask me? besides gaining experience and having strong technical understanding... I'm not sure, if I had the answer I would probably be richer that good ol' Steve, but I do have some theories:

1. Play to your strengths, if you are doing a bad job in a certain area and you know you are doing a bad job, get out of the way and maximize your value for the team, ex: if you are a product owner, but for the life of you, you cannot produce a ticket in good shape, either learn to do it, or step away from the task, if you do step away then the best thing you can do is help the team with the best problem definitions, to talk to the teams which are solving the problems, transfer to them your knowledge of the problem, or get someone who can produce a good formal definitions of the problems and focus on the high level abstractions.
2. If nobody knows where to go, putting a board with tickets will not tell you where to go, you need to adapt a more abstract way of working, if you will continue being reactive, then adopt a way of working that embraces reactivity, trying to put deadlines on this way only creates stress, embrace the uncertainty, you can put deadlines on big chunks of work and high level objectives, everything else will be constant failure, by the time you have actually finished creating your board, the requirements will be different again and it is time to whack another mole.
3. Create a functional hierarchy, put the people with at least a slight idea of where to go and how to get there on the top, a flat team of field experts is good, a flat team of lost people are only going to be more lost, everyone but especially young start-ups reject the idea of a typical corporate ladder, but I think they confuse the idea and blame the hierarchy instead of the non-functional parts, they throw the baby with the bath water, hierarchies are not inherently evil! wrong incentives and wrong people with power create non functional environments.  I could go on a on about my feelings and the ideas going through my head, but I'm sure of one thing, next time I get the chance to decide my fate, I'm not doing scrum or xp or the methodologies I now consider fads, I still hold the values of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development upmost, if at some point I see the need to have some sort of board with tickets I will go for it, but if I see I get a lot more value with just pure conversations and fuzzy deadlines, then so be it.
