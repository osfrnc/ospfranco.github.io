Some of the lessons experienced in the 10s and some objectives for 20s

## Team work

I've worked with teams, small teams, somewhat large teams, remote teams and office teams, the experience has been a mixed bag, sometimes good sometimes lacking in specific areas of expertise, learnt a lot about the business side of things, on programming not so much.

I did accumulate of experience as a tech/team lead, I could say this has been the most valuable one but to be honest now I'm trying to get away from it, I'm a fairly disagreeable person and I'm not really built to compromise and nudge people into executing a vision, funny that the biggest responsibilities I got were of this kind.

I have now started to read `how to win friends and influence people`, I can see why sales people see it as a classic, it is heavily oriented towards business but I think it contains a very interesting philosophy on life and how to behave around other people, something I have been grudgingly been doing for the last 10 years or so, now that I'm reaching 30, I think the time has come to slowly change my point of view, I've quit my job recently to going back to freelancing and I hope eventually open some sort of company on my own, tbh I'm a little scared but also excited about what the future holds, I have learnt however that relationships take a big part on success (even though there are outliers here and there that make it alone), so I'm putting a lot of focus on that for the next decade.

## On Programming

Since a lot of my team has been spent on team leadership, I have a lot of learnings on team work and software producing teams in general, while valuable it has meant a lot of my energy and focus was directed towards that topic, which means I somewhat fell behind on purely technical topics.

Learnt react and react-native which has been the main focus for quite some years now, that has been a mixed bag as well, while I do appreciate well crafted UI/UX experiences (and I really do enjoy design and visual arts in general), building front-ends can a be tiresome experience, from browser support to disagreements with the designers to fixing paddings for hours on end.

I did learn quite a few things about dev ops and back-end coding, was not my main focus, but I also don't think it is such a mystery to me anymore, nothing to amazing, I still have to wrap my head around some of the nitty gritty details (ex. HAProxy or really make good use of graphql), serverless also looks interesting though I still refuse to sign my life away to Bezos.

I do not have a problem with React or front-end coding per-se, I do however do not want to be seen as a one bullet gun and also would like to spend less time doing the nitty gritty work (again, fixing paddings), it brings me no joy since it is just time consuming work and not a challenge for me, the result is nice, but I care little for small details and prefer to concentrate that the big picture is working.

I would like to delve deeper into really technical topics, coming up the technical solutions, libraries and in general interesting stuff, as stated I really enjoy visual arts and started learning d3 recently, but maybe I should delve my toes even deeper into design topics, I would definitely like to do something with haskell, because WHY NOT the world needs more haskell and also create some developer tooling as a SaaS, something small that I can support myself.

## On life

Life in Germany has also been a mixed bag, sometimes I feel super grateful that I get to live here, Munich is super safe, super clean and can be a really nice city, but:

Loneliness is a problem, I deeply miss family and friends, I do have good friends now, which is one reason not to leave Munich for another city in Germany/Europe, at least I speak some german now... but since I changed jobs some of the close relationships are starting to feel distant, that does not give me confidence in the future.

Weather used to be a bigger problem, I'm somewhat used to it now, cold doesn't bother me as much, darkness is still shitty, not much I can do about that though, I would like to move to a somewhat bigger apartment though, but let's see how this year turns out with the job situation.

One thing is fairly clear to me now though, when I came to Munich I was in search of a new environment/new experiences, after three years I can (somewhat) say, task completed, now the question is what could be a reason to stay in Germany, and the thing that is clear: a complete "average" life here is not interesting to me, to work years on end to buy an apartment and go on vacation every year... doesn't work out, I would prefer going back to Bolivia, work at my own leisure, when I'm completely tired of work I can just stop for months on end and do something else, that is another kind of freedom which on first world countries is much harder and comes at a price for the future (European rent system, I have no faith in you when it is my time to retire), so there are to general overall directives for the (somewhat) immediate future: 1. Make something interesting, take the best advantage of Germany, either do something very technical/interesting (or at least take advantage of the market) that I would normally not be able to do back home, 2. Whatever that ends up being it has to either compensate me economically enough so I have fun with it or be a runway hit (also being able to work very very little for months but while living in Europe) so can justify myself staying here on a lifestyle basis.

Let's see what the next decade has in store, happy 2020 everyone and wish you the best.
