I'm working on a new macOS application and I was looking for some information on how to do something with the Combine framework and I stumbled into [this Medium article](https://medium.com/swlh/sinks-and-completion-handlers-in-swift-combine-d97e89e5b7f).

Honestly, I just dropped everything I was doing and now I'm writing this because I think it is the perfect example of industry wide know it all's, I would really prefer not to offend this so called lead developer but this is just too dumb.

Let me be clear about something, most of us (I include myself in this group) are technical coders, we learn the tools and have technical knowledge of computers, but we operate on the shoulders of giants, there are people out there, for whom I only have the upmost respect, the real deal, people so smart that make most of us look like a toddler with a plastic toy computer, people who create programming languages are among them, I have basic knowledge of how compilers work, can you imagine how hard it is to write an entire programming language that is turing complete, has all the orthogonal features one might need and is used by millions of people every day? I cannot even begging to fathom the weight of the responsibility.

And then comes the web and it is full of webshits and internets, who think they know better, who's biggest accomplishment is either making money, releasing a bunch of shitty webapps or having a fancy title granted by their company, in this particular case this industry "iOS" leader, starts ranting about a Monad... I'm wondering if he even know what a Monad is, and how pattern matching is being applied here and provides type safety and other nice mathematical properties.

To the creators and maintainers of swift, I apologize, to everyone out there who has created a tool and receives harsh unfounded criticism we don't deserve you.

We all make mistakes and I hope that article can at least be edited to make it clear that the author only has knowledge deep enough to rant about syntactic sugar.

Everyone is entitled to an opinion but at the very least one should be informed before making it public.

Learn about [pattern matching](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/patterns.html) and the [Result Monad](https://medium.com/@huund/monadic-error-handling-1e2ce66e3810), please.
