        Hey! I'm Oscar, I'm a software developer from Bolivia, living in Munich.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-900">
        I started working on a offshore company in Bolivia, after some months I
        switched to a being a freelance developer, eventually I decided to move
        to Europe, I worked at Mantro an innovation company and now at Capmo,
        where we make digital documentation for construction sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time, I've been working on the front-end and mobile parts of
        different apps, but when I was in college I was deeply into competitive
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyonce in a while I feel the need to write down stuff I do/discover
        in my day to day, I'm glad to be able to share it, but mostly I just
        need to put my thoughts down, so this is more a selfish endeavour.
