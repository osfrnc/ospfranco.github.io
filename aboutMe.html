        I'm Oscar, I'm a Software Engineer from Bolivia living in Munich since 2016.

        When I was a kid I lost count of how many times I broke my computer and had to take it to the repair shop,
        I never got around to actual coding but I just enjoyed tinkering with it, computers where not cheap and when even more expensive for Bolivia.

        After I finished school (I was at a German school, talk about destiny),I started studying the wrong career, after one year I got tired of the career and the environment it and finally my love for computers came
        through, so I switched to the state university and started studying Systems Engineering.

        During the college years I did a lot of competitive programming, my career was supposed to last 5 years I
        finished in 4 and also graduated with honors (I wanted to make up the time I lost), I started working for an
        american offshoring company, made some good (and very talented) friends but soon realized that management didn't
        care about the people in the company (country?), so I started freelancing, then I had a bunch of German
        customers and eventually ended up moving to Munich!

        I released an app for pilots in south america: <a

        also trying to build <a href="https://www.strest.io" class="text-blue-500">Strest</a>, as well as some
        contributions to OSS, ex: <a href="https://www.github.com/ospfranco/link-preview-js"

        Every once in a while I feel the need to write stuff down, they are mostly high level thoughts with some
        sprinkle of technical, I mostly prefer to write on the high level stuff, because I believe most of the time
        (which)
        technology you pick has little importance, nobody cares about the programming language or the tech stack, as
        long as it solves a problem, I
        could program in COBOL or PHP for all I care, as long as the solution works, everyone will be happy.

        I do however have more love for certain technologies, so here is more ranking of the stuff I've worked with:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>Haskell/Scala/Clojure > Typescript > Kotlin > Javascript (Swift is also not half bad)</li>
          <li>NestJS > Springboot > Any microservice/serverless architecture</li>
          <li>User Experience: Native Stuff > Hybrids, Developer Experience: React-Native</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p >
        I've worked with a lot of different stuff, but I live by the keep it simple mantra
      </p>
