        I'm Oscar, I'm a Software Engineer from Bolivia living in Munich since 2016.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        When I was a kid I cannot tell you how many times I broke my computer and had to take it to the repair shop,
        even then I was more into games than actual programming, this was the time when a pentium (I) computer with
        32mbs of RAM costed over 2000$us, that was a ton of money specially for Bolivia.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        After I finished school (I was at a German school, funny uh?), I actually started studying Finance Engineering,
        which was just a fancy title for an accountant career, also due to my mothers insistance I was enrolled in a
        very expensive university, after one year I got tired of (all of) it and finally my love for computers came
        through, so I switched to the state university and started studying something close to Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        During the college years I did a lot of competitive programming, my career was supposed to last 5 years I
        finished in 4 and also graduated with honors (I wanted to make up the time I lost), I started working for an
        american offshoring company, made some good (and very talented) friends but soon realized that management didn't
        care about the people in the company (country?), so I started freelancing, then I had a bunch of German
        customers and eventually ended up moving to Munich!

        I released an app for pilots in south america: <a

        also trying to build <a href="https://www.strest.io" class="text-blue-500">Strest</a>, as well as some
        contributions to OSS, ex: <a href="https://www.github.com/ospfranco/link-preview-js"

      <p class="my-4">
        Every once in a while I feel the need to write stuff down, they are mostly high level thoughts with some
        sprinkle of technical, I mostly prefer to write on the high level stuff, because I believe most of the time
        (which)
        technology you pick has little importance, nobody cares about the programming language or the tech stack, as
        long as it solves a problem, I
        could program in COBOL or PHP for all I care, as long as the solution works, everyone will be happy.
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I do however have more love for certain technologies, so here are some core beliefs:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-8">
          <li>Typescript > Javascript</li>
          <li>Haskell > Rust > Scala > Everything else</li>
          <li>NestJS > Springboot > Spring</li>
          <li>Native Mobile > React-Native > W/e is left here (ionic?)</li>
          <li>Redux > Mobx > Context > Hooks</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="my-4">
        I would have to include a lot more technologies/platforms/SaaS to be exhaustive, but there is no need, I've
        pretty much done/touched everything under the sun (with the exception of some advanced stuff, example AI, which
        I believe is a scam anyways)
