        Hey! I come from Bolivia and I've been living in Munich since 2016, I studied Systems Engineering, not quite computer science but related to it.
      </p>

        During the college years I did a lot of competitive programming and graduated with honors, I have a passion for functional programming and technical topics, eventually I moved to Germany, where I worked as team/tech lead.

        Every once in a while I feel the need to write stuff down, they are mostly high level thoughts with some
        sprinkle of code, I really like talking about the high level stuff, because I believe most of the time the programming language or the tech stack make little difference.
      </p>
      <p >
        There is one final thing, I believe that people have more value than computers, technologies or companies, I would much rather prefer to live a live full of happy people around me than the typical millonaire tech-bro.
