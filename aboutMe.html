        Originally from Bolivia, I moved to Munich 3 years ago, I've worked with
        large entities (Deutsche Bank, Linde, Subaru Germany), medium size
        companies (Mantro, CodeRoad) and a range of start-ups (WerkerApp, Capmo,
        Emonvia, HunterCo), I have now decided to start freelancing again to
        have more flexibility in my location and working hours.

        Everyonce in a while I feel the need to write down stuff I do/discover
        in my day to day, I'm glad to be able to share it, but mostly I just
        need to put my thoughts down, you can consider this blog a stack dump of
        my thoughts and experiences.
