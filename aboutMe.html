        Hola, I come from Bolivia and I've been living in Munich since 2016, I studied Systems Engineering (semi Computer Science).

        During the college I did a lot of competitive programming and graduated with honors, I have a passion for functional programming and technical topics, eventually I moved to Germany, where I worked as team/tech lead.

        I've have done a lof things in my career, full stack from servers to mobile apps, just writing some of the lessons and fun stuff learned along the way.

        I believe that people should be valued higher than tech and specially higher than money, don't ever want to chase the start-up dream.
