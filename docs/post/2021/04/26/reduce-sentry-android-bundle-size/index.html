      <div class="pt-12 markdown"><p>At work I convinced my team to switch from Crashlytics to <a href="sentry.io">Sentry</a>. Sentry is just a far more complete tool, however, due to our target audience and just the android ecosystem in general, we are very careful regarding our app’s apk size. Every added mb has a negative impact on how many people download/sign-up in our app. After adding Sentry our app grew by almost 2 megabytes, which is a step prize for us.</p>

<p>So I spent a bit of time trying to see if there was anything that could be done about it. Eventually reading the issues on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentry-android</code> repo (which is a direct dependency of the react-native version of the Sentry library), some people mentioned that NDK support (the framework to write C/C++ in android) seems to add a lot of unnecessary files.</p>

<p>The documentation directly mentions that if you don’t need NDK support, you can switch your dependency from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentry-android</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentry-android-core</code>. So I opened to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node_modules/@sentry/react-native/android/build.gradle</code> and changed the dependency there from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentry-android</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentry-android-core</code>. Then saved a patch with <a href="https://github.com/ds300/patch-package">patch-package</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards I simply built the app again (if you are doing local builds, you might want to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./gradlew clean</code> on your android folder to get rid of any caches), and <strong>it removes ~1.2 megabytes of the size of the app</strong>.</p>
