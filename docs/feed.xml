<h1 id="speed-is-relative">Speed is relative</h1>

<p>C++ is the fastest but Swift is fast, Java ByteCode is also fast. Using JSI/TurboModules won’t necessarily make your module faster. <strong>The JSI is a communication layer</strong>, therefore it excels in situations where you <strong>transfer</strong> a lot of data between native and JavaScript.</p>

<p>If you need to pass a few bytes once (or a few times), the old APIs are easier to work with and the performance penalty might be small enough that you might be better off skipping the JSI. Reading a small piece of data from AsyncStorage takes 5ms on release mode, so this extrapolates to any package that does a lot of calculation on the native side and then only returns a small chunk of data to JavaScript.</p>

<p>Here is a comparison, reading a small string (“hello”), one time (release mode -O2 optimized):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Framework</th>
      <th>Time</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>MMKV</td>
      <td>&gt; 0ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Quick SQLite</td>
      <td>&gt; 0ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>WatermelonDB</td>
      <td>&gt; 8ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Async Storage</td>
      <td>&gt; 5ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Artificial benchmarks testing reading the same value or calculating something thousands of times are… disingenuous.</p>

<p>Most frameworks have caches implemented to them, reading anything more than once results in testing if the cache is there. Other important details cannot be ignored: MMKV is a key/value storage, whereas Quick SQLite and WatermelonDB are relational databases on top of SQLite, comparing them is comparing apples to oranges.</p>

<p>Calculating data thousands of times will also mix JSI performance with C++/Swift/Kotlin performance, hard to tell when one ends and the other begins.</p>

<p>IMO it is better to test <strong>transferring a large amount of data</strong>. However, it is hard to find a test that actually makes sense, because details can affect the performance. Returning one large string will only mem-copy (Strings on your native code are not returned directly to JavaScript, but the memory needs to be copied to JSI Strings) once, whereas returning a lot of strings, will have allocate memory multiple times.</p>

<p>I can share some anecdotic experience of some people using Quick SQLite. <a href="https://dev.to/craftzdog/a-performant-way-to-use-pouchdb7-on-react-native-in-2022-24ej">Takuya experienced 2x to 5x speed boost</a> when switching from the old bridge SQLite driver, user <a href="https://twitter.com/sallar">@sallar</a> experienced 2x - 2.5x speed improvement, query time reduced from 600ms to ~250ms, with large SQLite queries. The larger your SQL results the better will Quick SQLite perform for you.</p>

<p>Just to be clear <strong>JSI does cuts the overhead of communication</strong>, transferring a few bytes once is just not the best use-case. It will also excel in cases where you transfer a small chunk of data but you need to do it very often, e.g. reanimated.</p>

<h1 id="i-want-to-use-xyz-programming-language">I want to use XYZ programming language</h1>

<p>Among the questions that get repeated over and over is “how can I use my favorite language?”. I even made a video about it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I6bH5_rO2k&amp;t=178s">go watch it</a>.</p>

<p>In the video I made a mistake, I made it sound like there is no possibility to use any other language, which is not technically correct. So here it is explained in a list so hopefully it will be clearer for everyone:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Everything is based on the JSI.</li>
  <li>The JSI is C++.</li>
  <li>TurboModules generates C++ headers (meant to be used with ObjC++ and JNI C++).</li>
  <li>TurboModules currently only allow to use implement the generated headers with ObjC++ and JNI C++.</li>
  <li><strong>You can use any language you want, if you can call it from the native mobile languages</strong>. If you can compile your code (and link it as a static library if necessary), you can just call it. It just misses the point of TurboModules, because a big reason is to give auto-generated type safety. Your compilation process might also become complex (e.g. using Rust)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use w/e you want, it’s just that you will have to manually modify and sync your function signatures. And to be clear this is partly a limitation of JSI and in some cases compatibility between languages (e.g. Swift and C++ interoperability).</p>

<h1 id="its-so-complex-flutter-is-easy">It’s so complex! Flutter is easy</h1>

<p>Don’t drink this cool-aid, all frameworks abstract the heavy-lifting for you. Even if you would write your app in native there would be occasions where you will have to deal with some complexity. If not on the language level, it would be on the API level, on some integration, on some framework model. etc. I have written a fair amount of native code at this point and I it doesn’t get any easier.</p>

<p>I have already seen tweets from flutter devs complaining they are writing dart/swift/kotlin/c++ code at the same time. If you are interested in this topic you are going deep into the inner working of the frameworks, this is usually what it takes to build software at this level.</p>

<p>As far as I can see here are the options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wait and hope someone solves your problem</li>
  <li>Create your own framework (With time you will hit the C++/Swift/Kotlin problem anyways)</li>
  <li>Pay someone to solve the problem for you</li>
  <li>DIY and enjoy the process</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s it for now, <a href="mailto:ospfranco@protonmail.com">you can always pay me to do some JSI for you</a>.

Instead of using the same tools I used to develop my apps, I always ended up importing a different framework, we used to use one many years ago with Java, on Node we used handlebars, this is just one more link of complexity in the modern tech stack.</p>

<p>I didn’t want to go down that path one more time, so I spend some time trying to answer one question: can I create a email template using only React and Tailwind (with my existing configuration) and the answer is: YES! well, mostly…</p>

<h2 id="render-a-react-component-to-plain-html-markup">Render a React component to plain HTML Markup</h2>

<p>The first part of this question was the easiest to answer, how to turn a React component into raw html string:</p>

<div class="language-ts highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// unfortunately no type information for this module</span>

<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">emailHtml</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">ReactDOMServer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">renderToStaticMarkup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">TestMail</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will take a React component and render it as a plain HTML markup, you can see I have a tailwind class in there <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py-3</code>, unfortunately if you take a look inside the html, you will see it has not been transpiled, so we need to run this html through an inliner to it inlines all the classes as embedded style props in the html.</p>

<p>This was the tricky part, there are some frameworks that try to solve this exact problem, like maizzle for example, but just by reading the home page I already see an ocean of complexity, so early in my googling I stumbled upon <a href="https://github.com/soheilpro/mailwind">Mailwind</a>, the instructions were scant, but it was exactly what I wanted, it works based on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/juice">Juice</a>, not going to bore you with the details, here is the snippet that makes it work:</p>

<div class="language-ts highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">juice</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">juice</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="nx">reject</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">`Could not juice email</span><span class="p">${</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="s2">`</span><span class="p">));</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>

        <span class="nx">resolve</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">processed</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You also need to update the email component to include a stylesheet in the head tag:</p>

<div class="language-ts highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">head</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
  <span class="p">{</span><span class="cm">/* eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-css-tags */</span><span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">link</span> <span class="nx">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">mailwind.css</span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="nx">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">stylesheet</span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="nx">data</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">inline</span> <span class="o">/&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sr">/head</span><span class="err">&gt;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can already see that you need to import mailwind.css file and make it accessible somewhere in your project, on the juicify function the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">relativeTo</code> path, will allow juice to correctly determine where to fetch the .css file</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And TA-DA you have working email templates with React and Tailwind, no need for complex framework, configuration files, etc. The juicify function will output a raw string, which you can send to your email distributor and it should work just fine.</p>

<h2 id="the-caveat">The caveat</h2>

<p>Now there is one small caveat here, which is the mailwind.css file, it’s not going to be your application styles, some of the changes are good, for example everything being based on px styles, but you might need your own colors, or paddings, etc.</p>

<p>TBH this is where I stopped because this is good enough for me, but if you really need your own styles, I figure this is not too hard to achieve, you basically need to tell tailwind to process your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tailwind.config.js</code> and spit out a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.css</code> file, shouldn’t be too hard, the small details of PX units I have not tried, but I think that should also be fixable. For me I only had to add 2 - 3 classes with some extra fill colors, and I can live with that.</p>]]></content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sending emails is basic SaaS 101, however it always feel broken to me.

<blockquote>
  <p>Use UUIDs for id-ing your entities. Period.</p>

  <p>Do not use anything else, don’t try to be clever, it just creates embedded logic and soon you will find yourself regexing your ids like a chump</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="lesson-never-learned">Lesson never learned</h2>

<p>I first came into this idea many years ago, my college professor was in charge of designing and leading the team responsible for the student system (assignments, class schedules, notes, etc), they bought an Israeli system and then adapted it for our university.</p>

<p>At the time, my professor thought it would be a great idea to make the user ids contain some extra information, so that one could at first glance tell the enrollment year and the student age, so each student id would be something like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[enrollment_year]_[birth_year]_[id_number]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is great in theory, whoemever is in charge already gets some information without needing to type the id into the system.</p>

<h2 id="embedded-logic">Embedded logic</h2>

<p>In real life, this created a slew of problems, one of them was that the students id were easily guessable, this created a lot of problems with phishing attempts, this had serious consequences.</p>

<p>But another more subtle was the consequence for the project code itself, since some of the information now did not need a query to the database, then came the REGEXES, to parse and extract this meta information from the IDs.</p>

<p>This generates a lot implicit and embedded logic, what if the ID needs to be changed? then entire parts of the system didn’t work properly anymore.</p>

<h2 id="regexes-are-fine-on-5-of-the-cases">REGEXES are fine on 5% of the cases</h2>

<p>Regexes definitely have their use cases, especially when extracting information from a third-party data source, where you have no control over the data you are getting.</p>

<p>But please, don’t ever try to embed data in your systems.</p>]]></content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Browsing my notes found this small gem]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How to install M1 (arm) compatible JDK</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/12/11/how-to-install-m1-(arm)-compatible-jdk/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to install M1 (arm) compatible JDK" /><published>2021-12-11T14:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-12-11T14:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/12/11/how%20to%20install%20m1%20(arm)%20compatible%20jdk</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/12/11/how-to-install-m1-(arm)-compatible-jdk/"><![CDATA[<p>Recently found out a nice trick to easily install a compatible JDK on mac without scouring the internet or brew formulas.</p>

<p>I believe the moment you have typed your code, it’s already becoming obsolete and it’s already wrong, because of your understanding of the problem will only expand with time, and since every problem is an ocean of complexity, you are pretty much hopeless in trying to code your way to enlightenment.</p>

<p>My approach: do OK code when solving the problem for the first time, fast, kinda dirty, see how it performs, see if it solves the problem, with a bit of time and patience you will see patterns solidify. The catch is: you have to clean it up, with the same energy and fervour you wrote it the first time.</p>

<p>I find this technique so invigorating though, instead of sloshing through endless discussions, I get the satisfaction of solving the problem first, instead of wasting my time on a potential dead-end. Afterwards, I get the pleasure of polishing the solution to a shiny state.</p>

<p>Consider a simple axiom: <strong>unexpected things happen all the time</strong>.</p>

<p>Some unexpected things are “common”: users input weird characters, things get deleted, libraries have unexpected behaviors, etc. However, there are other kind of unexpected things, things cannot be recovered from: disks get full, dynamic library is missing, program is missconfigured, etc. Today’s ecosystem treats every exception as equal by throwing exceptions.</p>

<p>The real problem comes when we forget to handle these exceptions or we don’t know the code we are calling can throw exceptions.</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// oops forgot to sanitize my input</span>
<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">userInput</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">10a</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">// APPLICATION CRASH! 10a cannot be parsed as a int!</span>
<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">date</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">originalDate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setDay</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userInput</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toISO</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="c1">// it might not even be thrown by the date library, but some second level dependency...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A lot of times this code is implicit and invisible to the application developer. The exception simply bulldozes and bubbles until it is catched or crashes the programm.</p>

<p>There lies one of the biggest problems: <strong>how do I know which function can throw?</strong> do I have to try/catch every line of code I have not written myself?</p>

<h1 id="kernel-errors">Kernel errors</h1>

<p>If exceptions are so disruptive to the flow of a program, why do we use them?</p>

<p>In the earlier days of computing, programs were not as brittle, that is because exceptions were reserved for kernel panic calls. If your program succesfully executed its task it would terminate with a 0 integer and anything else meant a unsuccessful execution. This is still visible in today’s shell scripts, where if a command fails with a non-zero exit code, it means it has not succesfully completed. Exceptions where reserved for Kernel panics, exactly those I mentioned (full disk, missing dll, etc.) and were meant to completely halt a program (or even the computer!)</p>

<p>Inspired by this kernel exceptions the developer community seems to have thought: “that’s a neat trick! I can just throw an exception here and catch it somewhere above my stack! It even unwinds the call stack for me!”. Other words: short-term convenience.</p>

<p>But this short-term convenience carried a price, <strong>it added implicit behavior to ALL code</strong>, you could no longer read the calling code and understand what was going on without understanding the whole.</p>

<p>I believe user code without exceptions makes for a easier pattern to understand, debug and maintain.</p>

<h1 id="error-carrying-monads">Error carrying monads</h1>

<p>What if every function not only returned the output but any error it produces.</p>

<div class="language-ts highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">userInput</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">10a</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">date</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">originalDate</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setDay</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userInput</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toISO</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// handle the error gracefully</span>
  <span class="k">return</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="c1">// do my thing</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This brings multiple benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Code that can fail becomes explicit (even better with TypeScript)</li>
  <li>Errors are part of the normal flow of a program</li>
  <li>Easily readable and the intention of the code is clear</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the new languages, like Rust or Swift, have now used composite types that carry this information, which will even force you to handle code that can fail. For example in Rust:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">enum</span> <span class="nb">Result</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">E</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nf">Ok</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">T</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="nf">Err</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">E</span><span class="p">),</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is what is called an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Error Monad</code>. This struct is not available in JavaScript yet, but you can return tuples or objects and the result is just as good!</p>

<h1 id="use-exceptions-for-real-panics">Use exceptions for real panics</h1>

<p>So now you can let real “exceptions” be what they were meant for <strong>unrecoverable program state</strong> and therefore should crash the application. Whereas the rest of your code will just be better.</p>

<p>I have encountered some libraries that follow this pattern, joi for example, as well as some API libraries like Stripe.</p>

<h1 id="references">References</h1>

<p>Although I tweeted about this issue before, it was only after reading <a href="https://humanlytyped.hashnode.dev/away-from-exceptions-errors-as-values">Barise’s article</a> that I decided to write my own. And there are many more articles on the topic: <a href="https://mattwarren.org/2016/12/20/Why-Exceptions-should-be-Exceptional/">some against exceptions</a> some <a href="https://blog.plan99.net/what-s-wrong-with-exceptions-nothing-cee2ed0616">for them</a>.</p>

<p>I believe some of the claims <strong>for</strong> exceptions are quite missguided, such as: fast prototyping! Stack traces! etc. Exceptions are definitely useful and as stated some of this mechanisms are golden for real exceptional situations, but hurt so much when used freely and carelessly.</p>

  <p>The error keeps the function frames around until it the stack string is created or it is garbage collected</p>

<p>It’s a bit of an edge case, but given a large enough application it’s bound to happen.</p>]]></content><author><name>Oscar Franco</name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Throwing exceptions makes programms unpredictable by breaking the normal control flow.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://ospfranco.com/assets/preview.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">How to visualize Flowtype dependency tree</title><link href="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/08/25/how-to-visualize-flowtype-dependency-tree/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to visualize Flowtype dependency tree" /><published>2021-08-25T15:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2021-08-25T15:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/08/25/how%20to%20visualize%20flowtype%20dependency%20tree</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ospfranco.com/post/2021/08/25/how-to-visualize-flowtype-dependency-tree/"><![CDATA[<p>At work we use <a href="https://flow.org">FlowType</a> on our JavaScript application. I’m a fan of JS type checkers, flow is not my favorite, but what is important is that it works.</p>

<p>However, when I joined the company I was surprised on how slow Flow was in our project. The project is large but not extremely large. Facebook codebase is orders of magnitude bigger, yet this is the performance I see sometimes</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hloQX8wG0t0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Upon saving this file, flow triggers a ~420 file dependency check and takes ~10 seconds to actually report any type errors.</p>

<h1 id="check-that-nothing-else-is-wrongly-set-up">Check that nothing else is wrongly set up</h1>

<p>First I started checking nothing was poorly set up in our project. A lot of the debugging <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68833468/how-to-debug-flowtype-extreme-slow-performance?noredirect=1#comment121793043_68833468">help came from Stack Overflow</a> and other people with flow experience.</p>

<p>Some of the things I tried:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deleting flow-typed definitions: sometimes they contain cycles or redundant definitions which can slow down flow</li>
  <li>Got rid of circular dependencies: we had 2 - 3 circular dependencies in our code</li>
  <li>Shuffled around types: Moved types here and there to no avail</li>
  <li>Messed around with the .flowconfig: set up LSP, lazy mode FS, changed max workers, toggled various flags</li>
  <li>Blamed the plugin: I’m using the FB plugin for flow on VSCode, which does seems to over-query the flow server on each keystroke, tried another plugin which only queries on save, feels like a minor improvement but still slow</li>
  <li>Tried several small flow repos: none experienced this slow down</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="assume-flow-is-actually-right">Assume flow is actually right</h1>

<p>Flow is a large project and facebook depends on it, so the chances that it is doing something wrong are slim, but I couldn’t believe making a change on certain file, did indeed trigger a 400+ file check. I needed to make sure.</p>

<p>I scoured the web trying to find out how debug the type dependency tree, but found nothing. The biggest pain point for me about flow, is the utter lack of documentation and community, the flow team also pays very little attention to the outside world and their priority is to support the facebook codebase.</p>

<p>After many hours ended up figuring out the right command to output the entire dependency graph for the app:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yarn flow graph dep-graph <span class="nt">--strip-root</span> <span class="nt">--out</span> ./output
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This however it only produces the entire app graph… you can imagine this file is hundred thousand of lines of dependencies. In any case, this outputs a DOT file (from graphviz), which in theory you can easily visualize by using the right command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># install dot via "brew install graphviz"</span>

<span class="c"># I tried a png first... it just fails</span>

dot <span class="nt">-Tsvg</span> output <span class="nt">-o</span> graph.svg
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This produces an svg so massive and so filled with squigly lines it is effectively useless… so I had to narrow down the output to just an entry file which I’m interested. Unfortunately the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">graph</code> command does not take an entry point to generate the graph, so I had to manually narrow down the graph that I had. Here is the gist with the script I ended up coming up with:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ospfranco/d599a68f1a2fe1f39a457162238fec78.js"></script>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I removed the first and last line of the graph file before passing it to the script</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This allowed me to crawl through the entries and finally specify an entry point to the sub-tree that interested me. Once narrowed down, I could finally produce another visualization, and the result is:</p>

<p><img src="https://ospfranco.com/assets/flowdep1.png" alt="flowdep1" title="flowdep1" /></p>

<p>Terrible! But not all is useless, I can see the direct imports from the file are correct… and I can indeed see things spiral out of control, importing certain files ends up pulling the entire application code!</p>

<p><img src="https://ospfranco.com/assets/flowdep2.png" alt="flowdep1" title="flowdep1" /></p>

<p>The count of objects in this sub-graph also seems to match closely the output produced by flow, this sub-graph has 415 nodes and the editor triggers a 420 file re-check.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion?</h1>

<p>Well… it seems to me Flow is doing nothing wrong, it indeed produces the correct dependency graph, but rather that our import structure has grown unchecked so large over the years that we have some architectural mistakes we cannot escape.</p>

<p>My current analysis is that Redux and Sagas are mostly to blame, the boiler plate nature of it and the coupling of action creators, action definitions and the reducers into single files ends up creating this web of dependencies.</p>

<p>Some very abstract suggestions for those along this path:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not place your action definitions (and creators if you use them) inside the same files as your reducers.</li>
  <li>The moment you start seeing a performance degradation in your type checking, is the time to figure out why, pushing the can down the road will lead to trouble.</li>
  <li>Come up with a sane import architecture, minimizing the dependencies between separate files. I think I will write about this in the future.</li>
