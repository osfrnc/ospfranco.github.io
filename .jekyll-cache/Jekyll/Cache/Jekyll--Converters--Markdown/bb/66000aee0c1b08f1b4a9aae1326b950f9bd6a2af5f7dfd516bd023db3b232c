I"©<p>If you are using javascript in different parts of your platform (mobile app, SPA web app, node server, etc.) at some point you might end up duplicating code between them, sometimes it makes a lot of sense to get rid of duplication, sharing models for example.</p>

<p>The deployments for this example are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>React SPA (redux, typescript)</li>
  <li>React-Native mobile app (redux, typescript)</li>
  <li>Main Springboot Server (Kotlin)</li>
  <li>Backoffice NestJS Server (Typescript)</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them reside within a mono repository, from which individual docker containers are built and deployed to the cloud.</p>

<h3 id="using-lernajs">Using lernajs</h3>

<p>Lernajs is a tool that shares codes within a monorepo, it handles your package dependencies by hoisting them to the root folder of the repo.</p>

<p>Imagine using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ramda</code> in all of your applications but installing it only once at the root. By hoisting, Lernajs does exactly that and symlinks it to the application <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">node_modules</code> folder. Furthermore, it has some nice little utilities that you can use to manage your workflow like adding new packages to applications, running multiple applications in parallel, etc.</p>

<p>Specifically what I wanted to share between the deployments: redux actions, redux reducers and epics, typescript models and some utility code, I crammed all this code into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code> package which is being used by our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> packages, declared as a dependency.</p>

<p>So what remains is mostly UI, routing and platform specific code. Below is how our folder structure looks like.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:5000/assets/Codesharing2.png" alt="Codehsaring1" title="Codehsaring1" />
<em>Our refactored code, shared contains common code</em></p>

<p>These are then imported in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> packages where we create our store (combing all the reducers from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code>) and root epic (combining all the epics from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code>). The reason for creating the store inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> packages rather than in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code> is simple; we want to have flexibility so that we can add other platforms specific modules or enhance reducers on a per application basis.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:5000/assets/Codesharing3.png" alt="Codehsaring3" title="Codehsaring3" />
<em>Assuming you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UserModel</code> class in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code> you would simple import it like so</em></p>

<p>For the redux actions, they are used as you would normally dispatch any action (the only difference being that your actions are now imported from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shared</code> package). You can of course, add more actions inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frontend</code>/<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> packages and supply your own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">epic</code> to handle them and itâ€™ll all work seamlesslyâ„¢.
You can read more about lerna on their website, but here are a couple of steps that we followed and should get you halfway there:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install lerna</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm install -g lerna</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Extract your code and place it at the root of your mono repository, you should also add a â€˜prepareâ€™ npm script, in our case we do typescript compilation to output to a lib folder</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run lerna init in your root folder</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lerna init</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modify your lerna.json to hoist your different packages (bonus tip, you can also leverage lerna with yarn), here is our lerna.json file:</p>

    <p><img src="http://localhost:5000/assets/Codesharing4.png" alt="Codesharing4" title="Codesharing4" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Link your shared folder</p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lerna add wa-core â€” scope=frontend</code></p>

    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lerna add wa-core â€” scope=mobile</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lerna bootstrap</code></p>

    <p>There might be some cases where you donâ€™t want some packages to be hoisted e.g. react-native. You can use a nice feature of yarn workspaces called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nohoist</code>, which would make lerna not hoist them to the root.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="using-typescript-3">Using Typescript 3.+</h3>

<p>The latest release of typescript has what they call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">project references</code>, this essentially is the same thing that we want, you can read more about it in their announcement post but here are a couple of steps to get you started.</p>

<p>After refactoring and extracting the shared code, your shared folder should contain a tsconfig.json folder, now in the package were you want to import this code, you should modify your tsconfig.json to contain the following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
â€¦
"composite": true,
"declaration": true,
"references": [
{ "path": "../shared" }
],
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once that is done, you can import your code by doing:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import { Foo } from â€˜../shared/Fooâ€™;</code></p>

<p>To compile your project you now have to pass the â€” build flag (or -b) and that should be it, typescript should hoist and transpile the referenced code for you.</p>
